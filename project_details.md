# Project Details

## Introduction
Real-world data rarely come clean. Using Python and its libraries, you will gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. You will document your wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook, plus showcase them through analyses and visualizations using Python (and its libraries).

## Main Steps

Here are the main steps. We'll go over each of these in more detail on the following pages.

1. Gather two datasets - successfully extract data using two different data gathering methods and combine the data.
2. Assess the data according to quality and tidiness metrics, identifying missing data.
3. Clean the data to solve the issues found in the assessing step.
4. Update the data store with the cleaned data.
5. Produce visualizations on the cleaned data, and answer a brief research question on the dataset.

In this project, you'll have the opportunity to apply the skills you acquired in the course by gathering and wrangling multiple real-world datasets of your choice.

In the end, you will have completed a professional data-wrangling process and be able to generate visualizations such as the following on cleaned data.
