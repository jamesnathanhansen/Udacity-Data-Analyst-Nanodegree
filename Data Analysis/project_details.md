# Project Details
## Introduction
For the final project, you will conduct your own data analysis within a Jupyter Notebook and use it to create a shareable file that documents your findings. You should start by taking a look at your dataset and brainstorming what questions you could answer using it. Then you should use pandas and NumPy to answer the questions you are most interested in, and create a report sharing the answers. You will not be required to use inferential statistics or machine learning to complete this project, but you should make it clear in your communications that your findings are tentative. This project is open-ended in that we are not looking for one right answer.

### Step One - Choose Your Dataset

#### Dataset: 
TMDb movie data - (cleaned from original data on Kaggle)
#### Overview and Notes
This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue.
* Certain columns, like ‘cast’ and ‘genres’, contain multiple values separated by pipe (|) characters.
* There are some odd characters in the ‘cast’ column. Don’t worry about cleaning them. You can leave them as is.
* The final two columns ending with “_adj” show the budget and revenue of the associated movie in terms of 2010 dollars, accounting for inflation over time.

#### Step Two - Get Organized
Eventually, you’ll want to submit your project (and share it with friends, family, and employers). Since we are using a Jupyter Notebook, you'll be able to submit both the code you wrote and the report of your findings in the same document.

It is recommended that you use the workspace provided in Project Workspace: Complete and Submit Project, where you can do all your work and submit the project directly.

If you are using the workspace provided for the project, you are in luck! The workspace is already organized for you. There you will find the Jupyter Notebook for your analysis and report, as well as the three datasets for you to choose from.

If you decide to work locally, get organized before you begin. We recommend creating a single folder that will eventually contain:
* The Jupyter Notebook you wrote as part of your analysis and report
* The dataset you used (which you will not need to submit)

You can download the notebook template and dataset of your choosing from the project workspace. It is a great starting point to help organize your investigation.

#### Step Three - Analyze Your Data
Brainstorm some questions you could answer using the data set you chose, then start answering those questions. You can find some questions in the data set options table above to help you get started.

Try and suggest questions that promote looking at relationships between multiple variables. You should aim to analyze at least one dependent variable and three independent variables in your investigation. Make sure you use NumPy and pandas where they are appropriate!

#### Step Four - Share Your Findings
Once you have finished analyzing the data, create a report that shares the findings you found most interesting. Make sure that your report text is contained in Markdown cells to clearly distinguish your comments and findings from your code work. Feel free to use other tools and software to craft your final report, but make sure that you can submit your report as an HTML or PDF file so that it can be opened easily.
